# Dataset-Normalizer
This Python class has the purpose of transforming a the variables in a dataset into standard Gaussian variables. 
Its use is the same as the classes in `sklearn.preprocessing`.
I'd recommend putting it in a Python module with similar content, such as `sklearn.preprocessing` or even `scipy.stats`.
